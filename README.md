# PlanetServer-M3

DaCHS resource descriptor defining the `planetserver_m3` EPNTAP service.

```
This service provides metadata information and hyperlinks to a
subset of the M3/Chandrayaan-1* spectral cubes dataset provided
by the PlanetServer/EarthServer-2 project as OGC/WCS endpoints.
The data here hyperlinked is a subset of the original archive,
composed by M3 L2 data, re-projected using the ISIS** software
to suit the interactive interface provided by the PlanetServer at
http://access.planetserver.eu/ as described in Figueira, R.M. et al, 2018.
The original dataset is described in Pieters, C.M. et al., 2009,
and is distributed in native format on the PDS Geosciences node and
ISRO Science Data Archive, https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/volumes/m3.html.
